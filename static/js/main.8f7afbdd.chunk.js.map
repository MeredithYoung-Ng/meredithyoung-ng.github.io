Free-hand manipulation\n          offers a way to more ergonomically generate 3D inputs compared to 2D\n          swiping on a smartphone screen; however, smartphone AR naturally has\n          a restricted interaction region due to the smartphone's limited view.\n          <br /><br />\n          We present Portalware, a smartphone-wearable dual-display system for\n          freehand 3D mid-air sketching in AR. Our wearable enables the user to\n          expand the usable interaction region via a wearable display to render\n          AR objects outside the smartphone's view. Portalware can be used in\n          two different interaction modes: smartphone-wearable mode, in which\n          the smartphone and wearable work in tandem to render sketched AR\n          objects, and pendant mode, in which the smartphone is worn like a\n          pendant with the wearable acting as the primary AR viewing display.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <p>1. Literature Review<br />\n          2. System Prototype<br />\n          3. Autobiographical Design<br /><br />\n          This project is done in collaboration with Jing Qian, Angel Cheung,\n          Xiangyu Li, Ian Gonsher, Tongyu Zhou, and Jeff Huang. I am\n          primarily responsible for the literature review, hardware prototyping\n          of the wearable, and developing the autobiographical design process.\n          My own personal goals for Portalware are to gain experience working\n          on user experience-focused combined hardware and software (graphics)\n          projects, and to learn how to become an effective HCI researcher.\n          <br /><br />\n          View our extended abstract at CHI 2020&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3334480.3383079\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            here\n          </a>.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Literature Review</h4>\n        <p>I began by conducting an extensive literature review of 3D sketching\n          in VR and AR, as well as on existing solutions to limited view ranges.\n          I noticed that the interaction region for existing freehand smartphone\n          AR systems was quite limited due to the inability to see AR objects\n          outside the smartphone's view. We then conceptualized the following\n          smartphone-wearable system design, which utilizes a wearable display\n          to render AR objects and interact with them outside the smartphone's\n          view:\n        </p>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={extendedview}\n        alt=\"Expanding Smartphone AR Interaction Region\"/>\n        <h4>System Prototype</h4>\n        <p>We expanded upon Portal-ble, an open-source smartphone AR system\n          with free-hand manipulation, through the addition of our hand-mounted\n          wearable. We use a dual fisheye-camera compatible with the Leap Motion\n          API for hand tracking, which communicates with the smartphone via a\n          server. The smartphone then determines what AR contents are near the\n          hand with the wearable, sending them to a Raspberry Pi 4 over\n          WebSockets, as shown in the system diagram below. The Pi then renders\n          the information to the SSD1351 OLED display in real-time at 60 FPS via\n          hardware SPI and the GPU using\n          the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/juj/fbcp-ili9341\" target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fbcp-ili9341 library</a>.\n        </p>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={systemdiagram} alt=\"Portalware System Diagram\"/>\n        <p>To create a more ergonomic user experience, we attach the Pi to\n          the wearable Portal-ble system and attach velcro to the SSD1351 so\n          that it can be mounted to the hand in a variety of configurations\n          (e.g., on the wrist like a watch, on the back of the palm, or on\n          the index finger like a ring). With AR, we can leverage interactions\n          with nearby physical objects in one's enviornment. Therefore, we\n          decided to use a pointing hand gesture with the index finger for\n          sketching, as it most closely mirrors tracing physical objects with a\n          hand.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-portalware-imgs\">\n          <input type=\"image\" src={wearable} alt=\"Portalware Wearable\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={components} alt=\"Portalware System Components\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Autobiographical Design</h4>\n        <p>Since every artist has their own inclinations and affinities for\n          different mediums, we decided to conduct a study with autobiographical\n          design to evaluate the Portalware system. In doing so, we had 3 of\n          our authors act as artists and our target long-term usage users, so\n          that we could rapidly iterate upon our system and personalize it for\n          each of them. We structured each studio evaluation session such that\n          there were tasks to elicit more user feedback about our system\n          challenges, such as depth perception, as well as time for open-ended\n          sketching.\n        </p>\n        <h4>What's next?</h4>\n        <p>Portalware is a work in progress!

I worked on modelling these\n          geometric input models for simulation, developing a 3D stitch\n          mesh-like language with a respective Blender model for each stitch\n          that can be outputted as a polyline and converted to a B-spline for\n          simulation of the CrochetMatic model.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <p>1. Designing 3D Stitch Models<br />\n          2. Converting Polylines to B-Splines<br />\n          3. Results<br /><br />\n          This project was done in collaboration with Steve Marschner. We also\n          worked with François Guimbretière and Amrit Kwatra, who worked on\n          building the physical CrochetMatic system. The project is still\n          on-going, and there is still a lot more to explore regarding more\n          complicated 3D knitted models.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Designing 3D Stitch Models</h4>\n        <p>Inspired by 3D stitch meshes, I worked on modeling each individual\n          stitch in Blender, designing an input language to determine physical\n          compatibility. Since a proposed CrochetMatic model needs to be\n          connected via one piece of yarn, I also made a script that checked the\n          model for connectivity.

Modeling<br />\n          2. Shading<br /><br />\n          My own personal goals for this project were to gain experience with\n          3D modeling and shading in Maya 2020.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Modeling</h4>\n        <p>There are 5 components: the base, lid, handle, and two screw caps\n          that connect the handle to the base (one features a holder to keep\n          the handle upright). The inside of the teapot base is also modeled.\n          Each of these 5 components has its own UV mapping as well.<br /><br />\n          There were two main technical challenges that I faced: 1) modeling the\n          inside of the teapot base, and 2) modeling the screw caps. The base\n          was tricky because I had to figure out how to model similarly shaped\n          holes on both the inner and outer shells, and then connect the faucet\n          to the cylindrical base such that the faucet also bridged the gap\n          between the inner and outer shells. At various points, I ended up with\n          extra edges (which appeared as a dark black rim via smooth shading)\n          and extra vertices. I eventually figured out how to fix the topology\n          by adding the originally intended edge loops and deleting faces such\n          that extra edges were removed, and also merging vertices together.\n          Modeling the screw caps was difficult because I was unsure how to best\n          model (connect) the caps' angled legs to the cylindrical-like cap. In\n          my first few attempts, the bridge between the legs and the cap was\n          twisted. This made several edges seem too sharp and also made the legs\n          look twisted, despite their intended boxy shape. Along the way, I\n          figured out that it was best to model the rest of the screw cap first\n          before bridging the cap and leg together, to maintain the cap's\n          cylindrical-like shape. I later figured out how to make a non-twisted\n          version of the bridged legs and cap by adding more edge loops to the\n          legs to better match the cap's bridge vertices.<br /><br />\n          Aesthetically, my biggest challenge was determining a better intuition\n          for modeling curved objects (e.g., the nubs on the screw cap holder).\n        </p>\n        <h4>Shading</h4>\n        <p>There are 3 main types of shaders: a ceramic shader for the red base,\n          a rough plastic shader for the handle and joinery, and a metallic\n          shader for the screws, washers, and teapot base rim. There are also\n          separate shaders for the inside of the teapot (which is a simple\n          black iron-like shader) and the bottom of the teapot, which features\n          a file texture with lettering (Le Creuset).<br /><br />\n          Ceramic shader: I started with an aiStandardSurface shader (ceramic\n          preset), and then added a ramp projection to generate the darker color\n          gradient around the wide jut of the teapot base. I adjusted the\n          diffuse and specular roughness, and also added a coat to make the\n          lighting highlights slightly less sharp but still make the ceramic\n          material appear glossy. To add wear and tear to this shader, I added\n          scratches and dents via a scratch texture bump map and dent texture\n          displacement shader, respectively.<br /><br />\n          Plastic shader: I started with an aiStandardSurface shader (plastic\n          preset). I adjusted the diffuse and specular roughness to make the\n          plastic appear more diffuse (less shiny). I also lowered the\n          subsurface scattering to make the handle appear darker and more\n          consistent with the rest of the teapot. Since the plastic handle and\n          joinery are rough to the touch (small bumps), I added some noise via\n          a bump map. To add additional realism to this shader, I added\n          fingerprints via a texture mapped to the specular roughness (with a\n          remapHSV node).<br /><br />\n          Metallic shader: I started with an aiStandardSurface shader (metal\n          preset). I adjusted the base color, as well as the specular parameters\n          and metalness, to make the metallic screw and teapot base rim slightly\n          less shiny and reflective.<br /><br />\n          The main technical challenge I faced was figuring out how to add\n          scratches and dents to the teapot base and lid to make it look\n          realistic. I ended up adding dents at specific locations via a\n          displacement map that I made in Photoshop that matches up to the UV\n          map, which was connected via a file node remapped to a displacement\n          shader. For scratches and smaller dents, I eventually figured out how\n          to do these via a bump map connected to the normal camera of the\n          ceramic shader. This was a similar process to how I added fingerprints\n          to the handle and lid knob.<br /><br />\n          Aesthetically, the biggest challenge I had was getting the plastic\n          material to be dark enough to match the teapot. The plastic shader had\n          so many highlights that it didn't look like it was really attached to\n          the teapot. In order to get the plastic and ceramic shaders to better\n          match, I noticed that the black plastic shader was much more diffuse\n          than the plastic preset. Ultimately, to get the plastic shader to\n          appear dark enough to be consistent with the ceramic shader, I had to\n          lower the strength of the subsurface scattering and the subsurface\n          scattering radius.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Reflection & Future Work</h4>\n        <p>My model can be improved by continuing to refine the screw\n          caps, as several of the quad faces appear curved on smooth mode. In\n          addition, the back bottom edge could be further refined. The bottoms\n          of the caps could also be modeled in finer detail, as there are metal\n          brackets attached to the teapot underneath the cap covers; however,\n          these are only somewhat visible when looking at the physical teapot up\n          close from a low angle.<br /><br />\n          The shading can be further improved by adding discoloration to some\n          of the bigger dents in the teapot body (as if the coat was chipping\n          off or melted off). These are the dents modeled in the displacement\n          shader component of the ceramic shading group. In addition, while I\n          did shade the bottom of the teapot (not shown in the turntable\n          animation), it could be further refined. In particular, there seems to\n          be a sharp colored edge between the bottom and the side in certain\n          areas at the UV seam; this could be smoothed out. The iron shader for\n          the inside of the teapot could also be further refined, if this was\n          used as a hero object (the inside is already modeled).\n        </p>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={teapot} alt=\"Teapot\"/>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-buttons\">\n          <Link to=\"/pathtracer\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              &#8249; Previous: Path Tracer\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/work\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Back to Portfolio\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/lechat\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Next: Le Chat &#8250;\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Teapot;\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nclass LeChat extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App-body-project\">\n        <h2>Le Chat</h2>\n        <h3>Oct. - Dec. 2019</h3>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-video\">\n          <iframe title=\"Le Chat\"\n          src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/492507007\" frameBorder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n          allowFullScreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Introduction</h4>\n        <p>To better understand the entire animation process, I worked on a\n          short animation from scratch together with Sarah Bawabe, Jiaju Ma, and\n          Andrew Peterson. Our story follows an inquisitive cat who interacts\n          with a computer AI (thus, the name Le Chat). I worked on modeling the\n          office furniture (desk, computer monitor, and office chair), shading\n          and lighting the office set, and animating the cat's walk cycle in\n          Maya 2020.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Features</h4>\n        <p>1. Modeling & Shading<br />\n          2. Lighting<br />\n          3. Walk Cycle<br /><br />\n        </p>\n        <h4>Modeling & Shading</h4>\n        <p>I worked on modeling the background objects in the office scene\n          (computer monitor, desk, and chair), including the UVs. I used\n          reference images found online to get the proportions right before\n          scaling the models to the scene.<br /><br />\n          I also worked on most of the shaders for my group, first starting\n          with a more realistic shading approach before we changed aesthetic\n          directions to more predominantly diffuse shading for a more cartoony\n          look.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Lighting</h4>\n        <p>I helped work on the lighting aesthetics for the office set. We went\n          with a cooler aesthetic (e.g., the blue walls) to contrast with Scene\n          2's vibrant maze set. The lighting is mostly motivated by the ceiling\n          light in the middle of the room, as well as a fill light from the\n          window. The lighting could be further improved by refining it to still\n          have some light behind the desk; we chose a lower emission value for\n          the ceiling light as the room is relatively dark once the scientist\n          exits. This, however, makes it hard to see the cat (we had to add a\n          rim light when the cat walks behind the desk in Scene 1).\n        </p>\n        <h4>Walk Cycle</h4>\n        <p>For the cat walk cycle, I followed several online tutorials. The walk\n          cycle could be further refined by continuing to adjust the blend\n          shapes and skinning of the rig, as the cat distorts when the\n          front and back legs of the left/right side are close together. In\n          addition, adding controls to the rig for the ankles would make the\n          contact points less awkward, as the ankles maintain their sharp angle\n          throughout the entire walk cycle. We tried to minimize these visual\n          distortions in our short through careful usage of camera angles.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Reflection</h4>\n        <p>Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this short together with my\n          teammates. It was fun to see what unique background experience and\n          skills my teammates had that ended up being useful, from Photoshop to\n          2D animation and music composition. I also got the opportunity to play\n          part of the background music in the first scene (violin).\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-buttons\">\n          <Link to=\"/Teapot\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              &#8249; Previous: Teapot\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/work\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Back to Portfolio\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/crochetmatic\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Next: Tile Tunes &#8250;\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default LeChat;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/surfacebrush-paper-figure.6392587a.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/surfacebrush-heart.dc963765.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/surfacebrush-bonsai-apple.3db4d0ce.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/surfacebrush-bonsai-print.9c10939d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/surfacebrush-bonsai-printable.33301524.png\";","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport skull from './imgs/surfacebrush.gif';\nimport paperfigure from './imgs/surfacebrush-paper-figure.jpg';\nimport heart from './imgs/surfacebrush-heart.gif';\nimport bonsaiapple from './imgs/surfacebrush-bonsai-apple.png';\nimport bonsaiprint from './imgs/surfacebrush-bonsai-print.png';\nimport bonsaiprintable from './imgs/surfacebrush-bonsai-printable.png';\n\nclass SurfaceBrush extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App-body-project\">\n        <h2>SurfaceBrush</h2>\n        <h3>Apr. – May 2020</h3>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={skull} alt=\"SurfaceBrush Skull\"/>\n        <h4>Introduction</h4>\n        <p>Mid-air 3D sketching tools in VR like Google TiltBrush enable\n          artists to draw in 3D directly with 3D input; however, these outputs\n          are disconnected from common 3D modeling output formats, especially\n          those used for physical fabrication.

One bug we ran into was having strips\n          repeated in multiple directions (due to the left and right matchings\n          for each stroke), which we fixed by checking whether the strip's\n          normal or its flipped version were already in our vertex map.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Closing the Gaps</h4>\n        <p>I worked on boundary smoothing, using the simple update according to\n          the change in angle of the triangle normals as explained in the paper.\n          I also implemented Laplacian smoothing as a small extension to create\n          smoother manifold output meshes. We also were able to reuse our code\n          for vertex matching and mesh strip generation between to close the\n          gaps with the modifications listed in the paper, running this process\n          mulitple times. A GIF of how the gaps were closed in multiple passes\n          for the heart is shown below.\n        </p>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={heart} alt=\"Heart\"/>\n        <h4>Results</h4>\n        <p>A GIF of our entire pipeline for the skull can be found below.</p>\n        <input type=\"image\" src={skull} alt=\"Skull\"/>\n        <p>We were also able to successfully input our bonsai tree output mesh\n          into Portalware (my 3D mid-air smartphone AR sketching project),\n          drawing apples on top of the bonsai, and also successfully load it\n          into 3D printing software, showcasing the many 3D modeling\n          applications the SurfaceBrush pipeline offers.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-surfacebrush-imgs\">\n          <input type=\"image\" src={bonsaiapple}\n          alt=\"Bonsai with sketched AR apples\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={bonsaiprint}\n          alt=\"Bonsai in 3D printing software\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={bonsaiprintable}\n          alt=\"Bonsai ready for printing in 3D printing software\"/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-buttons\">\n          <Link to=\"/crochetmatic\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              &#8249; Previous: CrochetMatic\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/work\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Back to Portfolio\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/pathtracer\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Next Up: Path Tracer &#8250;\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SurfaceBrush;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pathtracer-CornellBox-BRDF_Importance_Sampling_1000_x3_emission.5519b960.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pathtracer-CornellBox-Glossy_BRDF_Importance_Sampling_1000_x3_emission.1cda7369.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pathtracer-CornellBox-Mirror_1000_x3_emission.28f903b4.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pathtracer-CornellBox-Sphere_x10_emission.d789da5f.png\";","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport diffuse from './imgs/pathtracer-CornellBox-BRDF_Importance_Sampling_1000_x3_emission.png';\nimport glossy from './imgs/pathtracer-CornellBox-Glossy_BRDF_Importance_Sampling_1000_x3_emission.png';\nimport mirror from './imgs/pathtracer-CornellBox-Mirror_1000_x3_emission.png';\nimport glass from './imgs/pathtracer-CornellBox-Sphere_x10_emission.png';\n\nclass PathTracer extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App-body-project\">\n        <h2>Path Tracer</h2>\n        <h3>Feb. 2020</h3>\n        <div className=\"App-body-surfacebrush-imgs\">\n          <input type=\"image\" src={diffuse} alt=\"Diffuse Cornell Box with BRDF Importance Sampling\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={glossy} alt=\"Glossy Cornell Box with BRDF Importance Sampling\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={mirror} alt=\"Mirror Cornell Box\"/>\n          <input type=\"image\" src={glass} alt=\"Glass Cornell Box\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Introduction</h4>\n        <p>I worked on a CPU path tracer, a renderer that uses physically\n          accurate light transport, for my first project in CS 2240,\n          Brown's advanced computer graphics course.

Musical compositions often begin by writing\n          down notes on a sheet of paper or computer software. This creative\n          process, however, is noticeably more removed from the physical realm\n          of playing the music on an instrument. In addition, music\n          visualization is often disconnected from tangible interaction. We\n          seek to bridge this gap between musical ideas and the tangible world\n          through physical computing that fosters creativity.<br /><br />\n          Introducing Tile Tunes: a robot that moves along a user-drawn track\n          (two black lines), reading and interpreting colored paper ‘tiles’\n          along the track as musical notes. Two IR sensors at the front of the\n          robot follow the drawn track while a color sensor searches for and\n          interprets the colored tiles. When a color is interpreted as a\n          musical note, the respective note is visually displayed on an OLED\n          screen and sent to an audio breakout board, which outputs the note’s\n          sound through a connected speaker. Users can quickly make and modify\n          their own musical compositions in real-time by moving colored tiles\n          around the track.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <p>1.

I was primarily responsible for the electrical and\n          microcontroller components of the project. My own personal goals for\n          Tile Tunes were to gain experience working on user experience-focused\n          projects, and learning how to approach engineering with a\n          design-focused mindset.<br /><br />\n          View the full documentation&nbsp;\n          <a href={tiletunesdoc} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            here\n          </a>. Our code can be also be found on&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/MeredithYoung-Ng/Tile-Tunes\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            GitHub\n          </a>.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Related Work</h4>\n        <p>Our work is primarily inspired by Yuri Suzuki’s Colour Chaser\n          project, a vehicle that follows a freely-drawn black line track and\n          translates non-black lines (drawn over the track) into different\n          musical pitches [1]. In addition, other work such as Specdrums [2],\n          EyeMusic [3] and chromesthesia [4-5] translate color to pitch.\n          Overall, Tile Tunes focuses on the intersection of the broader\n          research areas of physical music composition and intelligent physical\n          systems.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Initial Design</h4>\n        <p>Our original idea for this project was a robot that reads colored\n          tiles along a fixed-width expandable railed track. Each colored tile\n          would correspond to a different musical note processed in real-time,\n          visualized on an OLED display and played on a speaker connected to an\n          audio breakout board.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-tiletunes-pics\">\n          <img src={tiletunesdesign} alt=\"Initial Design\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Ultimately, after feedback from potential users, we determined that\n          a free-drawn track would enable the user to have more creative\n          freedom. We then incorporated this idea into our low-fidelity\n          prototype.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>\n        <p>We proceeded to build several low-fidelity prototypes with cardboard\n          and LEGOs, as shown below. We performed simple Wizard-of-Oz testing to\n          simulate user interactions, ensuring that our design focused on\n          improving the tangible user experience of musical composition.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-tiletunes-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={tiletunescardboard} alt=\"Cardboard Prototype\"/>\n          <img src={tiletuneslego} alt=\"LEGO Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Initial High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>\n        <p>Incorporating feedback from our low-fidelity prototype testing into\n          our next iteration, we proceeded to build our first high-fidelity\n          prototype.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-tiletunes-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={tiletunesinitialCAD} alt=\"Initial CAD\"/>\n          <img src={tiletunesprototype1} alt=\"First High-Fidelity Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Our initial CAD (above) featured a T-slotted wooden box design,\n          with mounts for the motors at the front and the ball casters at the\n          back. We planned to have all of our electronics mounted on the top of\n          the box, but realized we needed additional space and incorporated a\n          second mount.<br /><br />\n          As our robot moves along the track, the TCS34725 color sensor\n          continuously reads colors from tiles along the track, sending input\n          via I2C to the RedBear Duo microcontroller, which checks if the\n          colors satisfy one of the predetermined HSL (Hue Saturation\n          Lightness) ranges. The RedBear then maps each detected color to\n          its respective note letter, and visually outputs it on the Adafruit\n          SSD1331 OLED display via SPI. <br /><br />\n          A second RedBear Duo microcontroller controls the motors via a simple\n          line-tracking algorithm based on the IR sensor readings.<br /><br />\n          For this prototype, we drew a single-lined track with a black\n          Sharpie, adding black lines to our colored tiles to prevent the IR\n          sensors from misinterpreting the tiles as the track. However, having\n          paper taped down was problematic in terms of reusability (the colored\n          paper rips upon removal), and also restricted a user’s ability to\n          make quick modifications to their track.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Final High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>\n        <p>Since our audio breakout board wasn’t supported by the RedBear, we\n          replaced the primary RedBear Duo with an Adafruit Feather M4, which\n          has a faster processor. Ultimately, we achieved full color, visual,\n          and audio integration. While we initially planned to play MP3 files,\n          we switched to MIDI and a portable speaker to achieve a crisper\n          sound. To accommodate all of these new electronic components on our\n          robot, we redesigned our robot with a more compact acrylic\n          three-tiered box frame (CAD below).<br /><br />\n          We also redesigned our track with two black lines, facilitating\n          easier musical tile composition. The tiles were redesigned with label\n          paper, as it was easy to print on, stuck flat to the track, was\n          sticky enough to be reused, and did not rip easily on removal. Now,\n          color tiles could simply be placed in between the lines.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-tiletunes-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={tiletunesfinalCAD} alt=\"Final CAD\"/>\n          <img src={tiletunes} alt=\"Final High-Fidelity Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Reflection & Future Work</h4>\n        <p>Overall, this project sparked my interest in HCI and physical\n          computing. It was also an amazing experience working with Alan and\n          Melissa—our strengths all balanced each other (Alan is a mechanical\n          engineering major, and Melissa is an information science major). This\n          also led to me working on CrochetMatic with Prof. François\n          Guimbretière.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-tiletunes-pics\">\n          <img src={tiletunesteam} alt=\"Team Pic\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Regarding future work, the next step we would take would be\n          implementing two-chord functionality. We would need additional\n          hardware—a microcontroller that can simultaneously run two I2C, one\n          SPI, and one UART bus, or an alternative color sensor. A\n          higher-quality color sensor would enable us to include more musical\n          notes, as the TCS34725 can be inconsistent. Finally, we would also\n          like to incorporate more user interaction methods with Tile Tunes.\n          Enabling the users to set the instrument and octave played by the\n          robot, upload custom sounds, and configure the mapping of colors to\n          musical notes would all enhance the user experience.\n        </p>\n        <h4>References</h4>\n        <p>[1] Yuri Suzuki. 2010.

Our robot combines gesturing\n          with its disco ball head (affirmative nodding and a horizontal ‘no’\n          motion), with dancing (horizontal 360° motion to enable twirling)\n          and colored lighting. With Wizard of Oz controls via a wired\n          joystick to control the horizontal base and an Android app to\n          control the head motion, Disco Bot is deployed in house party\n          settings to inclusively integrate individuals and groups into a\n          collective and connected dance group. To achieve this, we built\n          Disco Bot, which consists of a deconstructed disco ball, a 180°\n          servo, a stepper motor, two Arduino Unos, a HC-05 Bluetooth module,\n          and a 3D-printed mount and gears.<br /><br />\n          View the paper&nbsp;\n          <a href={discobotpaper} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            here\n          </a>.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <p>1.\tDesign Inspiration<br />\n          2.\tRelated Work<br />\n          3.\tStoryboarding & State Diagrams<br />\n          4.\tInitial Physical Prototype & User Testing<br />\n          5.\tHigh-Fidelity Prototypes & Additional User Testing<br />\n          6.\tReflection & Future Work<br /><br />\n          This was a joint work with Amanda Chen, Chelsea Chan, Caley Drooff,\n          Jackelyn Shen, and Shoshana Swell. My own personal goals for Disco\n          Bot were to improve my CAD skills and to gain experience in\n          interaction design.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>\n        <p>The brainstorming process for the disco robot began with an idea to\n          allow anyone to dance. We believe that everyone should feel\n          comfortable dancing at a party. We wanted to focus on group\n          interactions that allow people to meet each other, and dance\n          together. With these goals in mind, we designed Disco Bot to have\n          the power to make someone comfortable and have fun through dance.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Related Work</h4>\n        <p>Research addressing dancing robots mostly focus on the algorithms of\n          robots autonomously dancing to music. Grunberg et al. found an\n          algorithm for their autonomous dancing robot to match the tempo of\n          songs. These applications, however, are more closely related to robot\n          choreography and simulating human dance moves [1].<br /><br />\n          Keepon, a small creature-like robot, has nodding and panning control\n          which can be operated remotely, but doesn’t have more sophisticated\n          movement that inspires dance [2].<br /><br />\n          Travis, an expressive robotic speaker dock that dances and “bobs”\n          its head to the music played on it, focuses on human-robot\n          interaction [3]; however, we seek to influence group interactions.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Storyboarding & State Diagrams</h4>\n        <p>Before we began prototyping, we spent time storyboarding to help us\n          envision potential group interactions.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={discobotstoryboard1} alt=\"Storyboard\"/>\n          <img src={discobotstoryboard2} alt=\"Storyboard\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Analyzing our storyboards enabled us to narrow down our problem\n          space to the dance floor at a house party, repurposing a tabletop\n          disco ball instead of one hanging from the ceiling. We then began\n          building state diagrams to determine our Wizard of Oz interactions.\n          After several iterations, we decided to focus on two key\n          interactions: inviting newcomers and encouraging people on the\n          sidelines to dance.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={discobotstatediagram} alt=\"State Diagrams\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Initial Physical Prototype</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotprototype1} alt=\"Initial Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Our first prototype involved designing the U-mount to hold the disco\n          ball and servo motor, allowing for both vertical 180° “nodding”\n          motion of the disco ball and horizontal 360° rotational motion. We\n          used two 3D-printed gears, with one tightly fit to the disco ball and\n          the other attached to the servo. To control the Disco Bot, we used a\n          potentiometer to control the stepper, and another potentiometer and\n          three push buttons to control the disco ball’s vertical angle and\n          LEDs. However, we realized that the wires attached to the disco ball\n          were preventing the robot from achieving horizontal 360° motion.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Wireless Iteration, with Bluetooth</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotandroid} alt=\"Android App\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>To solve our wiring issues, we used an HC-05 Bluetooth module\n          connected to an Android app to control the LED colors and disco ball\n          head tilt. We created a table platform mount (below) for the\n          additional subsequent electronics, mounting an Arduino Uno upside\n          down above the breadboards to conserve vertical space.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={discobottableCAD} alt=\"Table Platform CAD\"/>\n          <img src={discobottable} alt=\"Table Platform\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>We also redesigned the base and taller U-mount into separate pieces\n          (base and 2 columns) for easier printing.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotprototype2} alt=\"Bluetooth Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>User Testing</h4>\n        <p>Our first user testing experiment was with a house party environment\n          and Wizard of Oz testing procedure. The DJ controlled the music\n          selection and horizontal movement through the hidden wired joystick,\n          with Disco Bot placed on the DJ booth table. Another group member\n          subtly controlled the vertical movement and lighting through the\n          Android app. We had 7 undergraduate participants.<br /><br />\n          Participants seemed visibly uncomfortable when entering the room, so\n          we focused on a welcoming interaction: when a group walked in, the\n          disco ball displayed a blue pattern, and followed the subjects as\n          they walked into the room through horizontal movement.<br /><br />\n          Focusing on gestures (e.g., affirmative head bobs) that caused people\n          to recognize Disco Bot as a friendly fellow dancing figure was\n          successful. We increased its bobbing frequency according to the\n          rhythm of the music during the testing session. Users thought the\n          robot was bobbing with the music and dancing with them. Several users\n          approached the robot to further investigate how it worked.<br /><br />\n          Upon analyzing post-experiment surveys, we found that most users\n          enjoyed the experience, noting how Disco Bot seemed “like a friend”\n          and how human-like our Disco Robot seemed. One user noted how the\n          beams seemed like arms and how the disco ball seemed like a head\n          with a mohawk.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Final Prototype</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={discobotbeam} alt=\"Beam CAD\"/>\n          <img src={discobotbeambase} alt=\"Interlocking Beam & Base CAD\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>We redesigned the beams with interlocking slots in the base so that\n          the beams holding the disco ball head would be more secure (above).\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotbase} alt=\"Final Base CAD\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>We also redesigned the base into two parts as the stepper motor\n          melted the previous PLA base: one small cross-shaped piece sat on the\n          stepper that interlocked tightly with the U-mount base (above).<br />\n          <br />\n          We added a spring and weight to test more anthropomorphic interactions\n          through an antenna, based on our user testing results. We drew an\n          eyeball on the tape holding the small weight to the spring to create\n          a more personalized, anthropomorphized version of our Disco Bot.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobot} alt=\"Final Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Additional User Testing</h4>\n        <p>We maintained similar testing conditions in our next study (four\n          undergraduates). The study began with a welcoming design with blue\n          lighting and horizontal movement that tracked people entering the\n          room. We tracked the person we thought would be most likely to dance\n          (whoever was bobbing their head to the beat of the music),\n          occasionally bobbing the disco ball head at them to gesture them to\n          dance. Then, we added a green spotlight and head bobs when this\n          person began dancing. This provided an affirmative incentive for\n          people to dance. This green spotlight moved horizontally with the\n          person who was dancing, plus vertical movement to make the disco ball\n          head bob with the dancer. We then focused on tracking a different\n          non-dancing guest. When someone wasn’t dancing in the testing session,\n          the robot would turn red and bob toward the person to dance similarly\n          to the earlier spotlight interaction.<br /><br />\n          Additionally, we specifically tested the antenna. People appeared to\n          view the Disco Bot as a friend, increasing the distance they would\n          move to approach it. Some people even tried gesturing at the robot\n          to get its attention, and one participant even started talking to it.\n          <br /><br />\n          When surveyed, they said that they felt more curious and comfortable\n          when the antenna was on the robot. They said that the antenna did not\n          really seem to make the robot catch their attention with the extra\n          motion more than without it; however, we observed that the extra\n          visual stimulation increased participants’ gaze towards Disco Bot.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Reflection & Future Work</h4>\n        <p>This was my first time approaching a hardware project entirely from\n          a design mindset—I learned a lot of valuable skills like\n          storyboarding and state diagrams, as well as the value in using a\n          sketchbook. I’m also much more comfortable with CAD. In the future,\n          I’m interested in doing more physical computing x design projects.\n          <br /><br />\n          Future work includes rebuilding the Disco Bot with metal rods and\n          spacers for better structural integrity. We could also laser cut the\n          table platform with acrylic a smaller vertical height for space and\n          weight efficiency. A stronger stepper motor would provide more\n          precise rotational motion and be less likely to heat up. In addition,\n          a continuous and more reliable servo would enable a greater range of\n          disco ball head motion. It would also be interesting to perform user\n          testing with and without the use of a 3D-printed shell, to further\n          test the effects of the Disco Bot’s current anthropomorphic\n          appearance. We also would perform user testing with more quantitative\n          measures to further test our hypotheses.<br /><br />\n          Fun Fact: The music in our video, discohaze, is actually by our\n          teammate Chelsea Chan (JAIE)!\n        </p>\n        <h4>Schematics</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotschematic1} alt=\"Disco Bot Schematic\"/>\n          <img src={discobotschematic2} alt=\"Joystick Schematic\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>References</h4>\n        <p>[1]\tGrunberg, David & Ellenberg, Robert & E.

Pawtucket as the first and only children’s museum\n          in Rhode Island. Since relocating to Providence in 1997, the museum\n          has attracted over 2.5 million visitors through its interactive\n          exhibits and hands-on learning environments. Currently, its website\n          provides information about visiting, current exhibits, how to support\n          the museum, and more; however, the website’s inconsistent and\n          unorganized design makes it difficult to find pertinent information.\n          Furthermore, the lack of responsiveness makes it difficult to use on\n          other screen sizes.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-pvdcm-section\">Overview</h4>\n        <p>1.

Our goal:\n          redesign the homepage, focusing on improving its usability and\n          aesthetic appearance. We worked together on the usability redesign,\n          sketching & wireframes, and navigation flowchart.

To improve readability, we\n          used small blocks of text, bolded headings, 2 accent colors from the\n          logo, a grid layout for exhibit information, and increased white\n          space in the layout. We aligned images and text in a consistent\n          manner to better organize page content, increasing image size to make\n          the page layout more accessible. We implemented an underline in the\n          navigation bar which appears on hover to indicate clickable links.\n          To highlight pages with key information, we relocated the shortened\n          navigation bar to the top. Important information (e.g., the museum’s\n          address and hours) is now displayed in the footer.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-pvdcm-figure\">\n          <img src={pvdcmmockup} alt=\"Annotated Homepage Mockup\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-pvdcm-section\">Responsive Homepage</h4>\n        <p>View the responsive version of the homepage&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://meredithyoung-ng.github.io/pvd_childrens_museum_redesign\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-pvdcm\">\n            here\n          </a>!

Currently, our webpage closely matches our\n          homepage, except for the menu (an icon). In the future, we could use\n          React to implement this functionality. In addition, we could make the\n          homepage more consistent with the exhibits page by implementing a\n          carousel in React for featured exhibits.

By\n          college, women only earn 18% of all computer science degrees, and\n          &#60; 20&#37; of people in tech are women. While women have\n          continuously made (and continue to make) influential contributions to\n          all fields of computer science, the gender gap in computer science\n          persists. My webpage aims to provide an interactive experience for\n          people to learn more about the depth of the history of women in\n          computer science, and to provide resources for people to start\n          learning how to code. It only takes one person—YOU—to start helping\n          me bridge the gender gap in computer science.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">Overview</h4>\n        <p>My design process for this project was as follows:<br />\n          1.\tResearch<br />\n          2.\tLow-Fidelity Prototypes (Sketches) & User Testing <br />\n          3.\tHigh-Fidelity Prototypes: Adobe XD & Website (React)<br />\n          4.\tReflection & Future Work<br /><br />\n          Throughout all of my diversity in engineering outreach, I’ve always\n          wondered how I could help bridge the gender gap on a more global\n          scale. As I progressed in my engineering career, I’ve always been\n          presented with the same key historical women in computing (e.g.,\n          Grace Hopper)—I wanted to bring more attention to some of the\n          lesser-known women in computing, and highlight their achievements.\n          This manifested as my Bridging the Gender Gap in Computer Science\n          website.

This enabled me to better\n          visualize my webpage before I began coding.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-webpage\">\n          <img src={wicshistoryadobexd} alt=\"High-Fidelity Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>I coded my final prototype using React. My webpage has a cover image\n          that attracts attention to the statistics regarding this issue, and\n          cuts off after the “History” header to indicate that there is more\n          information below. The navbar also provides affordances to show other\n          sections of the page (History and Learn). Arrows indicate that the\n          filtering dropdown buttons (Field and Country) expand to show more\n          options. In addition, the dropdown buttons render whatever Field and\n          Country is selected, once the user selects an option. I decided to use\n          green and blue in my color theme, as the “calmer” colors in the red,\n          green, and blue rendering trio. The blue in the color theme is used to\n          accentuate potential user actions, particularly for buttons and\n          keywords.<br /><br />\n          Data is passed through props to <span id=\"codeFont\">FilteredList\n          </span>, <span id=\"codeFont\">CardYou</span>, and <span id=\"codeFont\">\n          CodingExp</span>.

Filters (field and country) and sorting (by\n          date of birth) can be achieved by clicking the appropriate filter\n          from the dropdown and the sorting checkbox, respectively.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CardYou</span>&nbsp;uses the default “You”\n          information through props default values for the user inputs\n          in&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>. Clicking the “Join Us”\n          button renders whatever information the user has entered in the text\n          entry form (name, birth year, field, and country) on the “You” card by\n          updating&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>&nbsp;and the\n          “You”&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">Card</span>&nbsp;component.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CodingExp</span> uses the selected radio button\n          option to recommend coding resources to the user based on their coding\n          experience when the user clicks the “Let’s Get Started” button.
