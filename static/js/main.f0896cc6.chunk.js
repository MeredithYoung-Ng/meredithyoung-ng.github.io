Then, we added a green spotlight and head bobs when this person began dancing. This provided an affirmative incentive for people to dance. This green spotlight moved horizontally with the person who was dancing, plus vertical movement to make the disco ball head bob with the dancer.

In addition, a continuous and more reliable servo would enable a greater range of disco ball head motion.
