The <span id=\"codeFont\">FilteredList</span>\n          &nbsp;component filters and sorts through the database of historical\n          women computer scientists, with the <span id=\"codeFont\">List</span>\n          &nbsp;component rendering the <span id=\"codeFont\">Card</span>&#32; of\n          each woman as applicable. Filters (field and country) and sorting (by\n          date of birth) can be achieved by clicking the appropriate filter\n          from the dropdown and the sorting checkbox, respectively.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CardYou</span>&nbsp;uses the default “You”\n          information through props default values for the user inputs\n          in&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>. Clicking the “Join Us”\n          button renders whatever information the user has entered in the text\n          entry form (name, birth year, field, and country) on the “You” card by\n          updating&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>&nbsp;and the\n          “You”&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">Card</span>&nbsp;component.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CodingExp</span> uses the selected radio button\n          option to recommend coding resources to the user based on their coding\n          experience when the user clicks the “Let’s Get Started” button. The\n          coding experience options for the radio buttons and labels are\n          referenced through <span id=\"codeFont\">this.props.choices</span>,\n          and the currently selected radio button id is stored in state as&nbsp;\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">checkedRadio</span>. This is updated every time\n          the user selects a different option. The resources shown (rendered)\n          change each time the user clicks the “Let’s Get Started” button via\n          updating the value of <span id=\"codeFont\">resourceOption</span>&nbsp;\n          in&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>.<br /><br />\n          My final prototype is currently hosted on Heroku&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://wics-history.herokuapp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">here</a>.\n          View the code&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/MeredithYoung-Ng/wics-history\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">\n          here</a> on GitHub.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">Reflection & Future Work</h4>\n        <p>This project enabled me to utilize all the UI/UX design skills that\n          I’ve learned in my UI/UX class, and apply them towards one of my\n          personal interests (helping increase diversity in computing!).\n          Currently, the webpage only supports laptop internet browsers viewed\n          at full-screen. In the future, I plan on expanding the supported\n          responsiveness functionality for other sized screens and devices. In\n          addition, it would be nice to add some interactive mentorship feature\n          to emphasize the community involvement aspect of bridging the gender\n          gap in computer science.<br /><br />\n          Fun Fact: At Cornell, I fell in love with algorithms after taking a\n          class with Prof. Éva Tardos (one of the featured women on my webpage!)\n          and Prof. Alexandra (Xanda) Schofield, two of my most inspirational\n          role models.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-webpage\">\n          <img src={wicshistorywebsite} alt=\"Website\"/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-button\">\n          <Link to=\"/work\">\n            <button type=\"button\">\n              Back to Portfolio\n            </button>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default WiCSHistory;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
