With Wizard of Oz controls via a wired joystick to control the horizontal base and an Android app to control the head motion, Disco Bot is deployed in house party settings to inclusively integrate individuals and groups into a collective and connected dance group.

interactions between guests at a house\n          party with better social inclusivity. Our robot combines gesturing\n          with its disco ball head (affirmative nodding and a horizontal ‘no’\n          motion), with dancing (horizontal 360° motion to enable twirling)\n          and colored lighting. With Wizard of Oz controls via a wired\n          joystick to control the horizontal base and an Android app to\n          control the head motion, Disco Bot is deployed in house party\n          settings to inclusively integrate individuals and groups into a\n          collective and connected dance group. To achieve this, we built\n          Disco Bot, which consists of a deconstructed disco ball, a 180°\n          servo, a stepper motor, two Arduino Unos, a HC-05 Bluetooth module,\n          and a 3D-printed mount and gears.<br /><br />\n          View the paper&nbsp;\n          <a href={discobotpaper} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            here\n          </a>.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Overview</h4>\n        <p>1.\tDesign Inspiration<br />\n          2.\tRelated Work<br />\n          3.\tStoryboarding & State Diagrams<br />\n          4.\tInitial Physical Prototype & User Testing<br />\n          5.\tHigh-Fidelity Prototypes & Additional User Testing<br />\n          6.\tReflection & Future Work<br /><br />\n          This was a joint work with Amanda Chen, Chelsea Chan, Caley Drooff,\n          Jackelyn Shen, and Shoshana Swell. My own personal goals for Disco\n          Bot were to improve my CAD skills and to gain experience in\n          interaction design.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>\n        <p>The brainstorming process for the disco robot began with an idea to\n          allow anyone to dance. We believe that everyone should feel\n          comfortable dancing at a party. We wanted to focus on group\n          interactions that allow people to meet each other, and dance\n          together. With these goals in mind, we designed Disco Bot to have\n          the power to make someone comfortable and have fun through dance.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Related Work</h4>\n        <p>Research addressing dancing robots mostly focus on the algorithms of\n          robots autonomously dancing to music. Grunberg et al. found an\n          algorithm for their autonomous dancing robot to match the tempo of\n          songs. These applications, however, are more closely related to robot\n          choreography and simulating human dance moves [1].<br /><br />\n          Keepon, a small creature-like robot, has nodding and panning control\n          which can be operated remotely, but doesn’t have more sophisticated\n          movement that inspires dance [2].<br /><br />\n          Travis, an expressive robotic speaker dock that dances and “bobs”\n          its head to the music played on it, focuses on human-robot\n          interaction [3]; however, we seek to influence group interactions.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Storyboarding & State Diagrams</h4>\n        <p>Before we began prototyping, we spent time storyboarding to help us\n          envision potential group interactions.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={discobotstoryboard1} alt=\"Storyboard\"/>\n          <img src={discobotstoryboard2} alt=\"Storyboard\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Analyzing our storyboards enabled us to narrow down our problem\n          space to the dance floor at a house party, repurposing a tabletop\n          disco ball instead of one hanging from the ceiling. We then began\n          building state diagrams to determine our Wizard of Oz interactions.\n          After several iterations, we decided to focus on two key\n          interactions: inviting newcomers and encouraging people on the\n          sidelines to dance.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={discobotstatediagram} alt=\"State Diagrams\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Initial Physical Prototype</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotprototype1} alt=\"Initial Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Our first prototype involved designing the U-mount to hold the disco\n          ball and servo motor, allowing for both vertical 180° “nodding”\n          motion of the disco ball and horizontal 360° rotational motion. We\n          used two 3D-printed gears, with one tightly fit to the disco ball and\n          the other attached to the servo. To control the Disco Bot, we used a\n          potentiometer to control the stepper, and another potentiometer and\n          three push buttons to control the disco ball’s vertical angle and\n          LEDs. However, we realized that the wires attached to the disco ball\n          were preventing the robot from achieving horizontal 360° motion.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Wireless Iteration, with Bluetooth</h4>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotandroid} alt=\"Android App\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>To solve our wiring issues, we used an HC-05 Bluetooth module\n          connected to an Android app to control the LED colors and disco ball\n          head tilt. We created a table platform mount (below) for the\n          additional subsequent electronics, mounting an Arduino Uno upside\n          down above the breadboards to conserve vertical space.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img id=\"leftimg\" src={discobottableCAD} alt=\"Table Platform CAD\"/>\n          <img src={discobottable} alt=\"Table Platform\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>We also redesigned the base and taller U-mount into separate pieces\n          (base and 2 columns) for easier printing.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-discobot-pics\">\n          <img src={discobotprototype2} alt=\"Bluetooth Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4>User Testing</h4>\n        <p>Our first user testing experiment was with a house party environment\n          and Wizard of Oz testing procedure. The DJ controlled the music\n          selection and horizontal movement through the hidden wired joystick,\n          with Disco Bot placed on the DJ booth table. Another group member\n          subtly controlled the vertical movement and lighting through the\n          Android app. We had 7 undergraduate participants.<br /><br />\n          Participants seemed visibly uncomfortable when entering the room, so\n          we focused on a welcoming interaction: when a group walked in, the\n          disco ball displayed a blue pattern, and followed the subjects as\n          they walked into the room through horizontal movement.<br /><br />\n          Focusing on gestures (e.g., affirmative head bobs) that caused people\n          to recognize Disco Bot as a friendly fellow dancing figure was\n          successful. We increased its bobbing frequency according to the\n          rhythm of the music during the testing session. Users thought the\n          robot was bobbing with the music and dancing with them. Several users\n          approached the robot to further investigate how it worked.<br /><br />\n          Upon analyzing post-experiment surveys, we found that most users\n          enjoyed the experience, noting how Disco Bot seemed “like a friend”\n          and how human-like our Disco Robot seemed. One user noted how the\n          beams seemed like arms and how the disco ball seemed like a head\n          with a mohawk.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DiscoBot;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
