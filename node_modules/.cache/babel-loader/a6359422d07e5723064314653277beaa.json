<p>Studies show that girls lose interest in STEM by middle school. By\n          college, women only earn 18% of all computer science degrees, and\n          &#60; 20&#37; of people in tech are women. While women have\n          continuously made (and continue to make) influential contributions to\n          all fields of computer science, the gender gap in computer science\n          persists. My webpage aims to provide an interactive experience for\n          people to learn more about the depth of the history of women in\n          computer science, and to provide resources for people to start\n          learning how to code. It only takes one person—YOU—to start helping\n          me bridge the gender gap in computer science.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">Overview</h4>\n        <p>My design process for this project was as follows:<br />\n          1.\tResearch<br />\n          2.\tLow-Fidelity Prototypes (Sketches) & User Testing <br />\n          3.\tHigh-Fidelity Prototypes: Adobe XD & Website (React)<br />\n          4.\tReflection & Future Work<br /><br />\n          Throughout all of my diversity in engineering outreach, I’ve always\n          wondered how I could help bridge the gender gap on a more global\n          scale. As I progressed in my engineering career, I’ve always been\n          presented with the same key historical women in computing (e.g.,\n          Grace Hopper)—I wanted to bring more attention to some of the\n          lesser-known women in computing, and highlight their achievements.\n          This manifested as my Bridging the Gender Gap in Computer Science\n          website. Along the way, I learned Adobe XD, React, and how to host\n          an app on Heroku.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">Research</h4>\n        <p>Before I began prototyping, I decided to see how other webpages\n          represent the history of women in computer science and engineering.\n          Wikipedia has its&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">\n            Women in computing\n          </a> page and a comprehensive&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women_in_computing\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">\n            timeline of women in computing\n          </a>\n          ; however, these lists don’t have pictures humanizing the women in\n          addition to their academic achievements.

The\n          significance of these academic achievements is also not clear to\n          someone without a background in computing. Other websites such as\n          EngineerGirl and League of Coders primarily focus on women engineers\n          in the US; further biographical information such as their field and\n          lifetime aren’t listed next to their names and pictures. <br /><br />\n          Based on my research analysis, I started sketching prototypes, as\n          shown below.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={wicshistorynotebook1} alt=\"Sketches\"/>\n          <img src={wicshistorynotebook2} alt=\"Sketches\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>Before sketching my next prototype, I conducted some simple Wizard\n          of Oz testing using convenience sampling.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-notebook\">\n          <img src={wicshistorynotebook3} alt=\"Low-Fidelity Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">High-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>\n        <p>After sketching my webpage design, I decided to make a high-fidelity\n          prototype in AdobeXD as shown below. This enabled me to better\n          visualize my webpage before I began coding.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-project-webpage\">\n          <img src={wicshistoryadobexd} alt=\"High-Fidelity Prototype\"/>\n        </div>\n        <p>I coded my final prototype using React. My webpage has a cover image\n          that attracts attention to the statistics regarding this issue, and\n          cuts off after the “History” header to indicate that there is more\n          information below. The navbar also provides affordances to show other\n          sections of the page (History and Learn). Arrows indicate that the\n          filtering dropdown buttons (Field and Country) expand to show more\n          options. In addition, the dropdown buttons render whatever Field and\n          Country is selected, once the user selects an option. I decided to use\n          green and blue in my color theme, as the “calmer” colors in the red,\n          green, and blue rendering trio. The blue in the color theme is used to\n          accentuate potential user actions, particularly for buttons and\n          keywords.<br /><br />\n          Data is passed through props to <span id=\"codeFont\">FilteredList\n          </span>, <span id=\"codeFont\">CardYou</span>, and <span id=\"codeFont\">\n          CodingExp</span>. The <span id=\"codeFont\">FilteredList</span>\n          &nbsp;component filters and sorts through the database of historical\n          women computer scientists, with the <span id=\"codeFont\">List</span>\n          &nbsp;component rendering the <span id=\"codeFont\">Card</span>&#32; of\n          each woman as applicable. Filters (field and country) and sorting (by\n          date of birth) can be achieved by clicking the appropriate filter\n          from the dropdown and the sorting checkbox, respectively.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CardYou</span>&nbsp;uses the default “You”\n          information through props default values for the user inputs\n          in&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>. Clicking the “Join Us”\n          button renders whatever information the user has entered in the text\n          entry form (name, birth year, field, and country) on the “You” card by\n          updating&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>&nbsp;and the\n          “You”&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">Card</span>&nbsp;component.<br /><br />\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">CodingExp</span> uses the selected radio button\n          option to recommend coding resources to the user based on their coding\n          experience when the user clicks the “Let’s Get Started” button. The\n          coding experience options for the radio buttons and labels are\n          referenced through <span id=\"codeFont\">this.props.choices</span>,\n          and the currently selected radio button id is stored in state as&nbsp;\n          <span id=\"codeFont\">checkedRadio</span>. This is updated every time\n          the user selects a different option. The resources shown (rendered)\n          change each time the user clicks the “Let’s Get Started” button via\n          updating the value of <span id=\"codeFont\">resourceOption</span>&nbsp;\n          in&nbsp;<span id=\"codeFont\">state</span>.<br /><br />\n          My final prototype is currently hosted on Heroku&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://wics-history.herokuapp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">here</a>.\n          View the code&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/MeredithYoung-Ng/wics-history\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-wics\">\n          here</a> on GitHub.\n        </p>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-wics-section\">Reflection & Future Work</h4>\n        <p>This project enabled me to utilize all the UI/UX design skills that\n          I’ve learned in my UI/UX class, and apply them towards one of my\n          personal interests (helping increase diversity in computing!).\n          Currently, the webpage only supports laptop internet browsers viewed\n          at full-screen.
