To improve readability, we\n          used small blocks of text, bolded headings, 2 accent colors from the\n          logo, a grid layout for exhibit information, and increased white\n          space in the layout. We aligned images and text in a consistent\n          manner to better organize page content, increasing image size to make\n          the page layout more accessible. We implemented an underline in the\n          navigation bar which appears on hover to indicate clickable links.\n          To highlight pages with key information, we relocated the shortened\n          navigation bar to the top. Important information (e.g., the museum’s\n          address and hours) is now displayed in the footer.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"App-body-pvdcm-figure\">\n          <img src={pvdcmmockup} alt=\"Annotated Homepage Mockup\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h4 className=\"App-body-pvdcm-section\">Responsive Homepage</h4>\n        <p>View the responsive version of the homepage&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://meredithyoung-ng.github.io/pvd_childrens_museum_redesign\"\n          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"link-pvdcm\">\n            here\n          </a>!

Currently, our webpage closely matches our\n          homepage, except for the menu (an icon). In the future, we could use\n          React to implement this functionality. In addition, we could make the\n          homepage more consistent with the exhibits page by implementing a\n          carousel in React for featured exhibits. Finally, we would implement\n          the rest of the redesigned webpages.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default PVDCM;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
